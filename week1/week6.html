        <p class="reflection">Sanghyuk Park</p>

        <p>I came across Sanghyuk Park when I seen his work on Naver, which is the most popular/common website in Korea -- think of it as Google of Korea. Just like how Google has differnt logos for events, Naver does the same thing and Sanghyuk Park was one of the illustrators/designers to create the one for 2018 paralympic. Just like all the other illustrators and designers that I have covered for past few weeks, his work is very simple yet has finished quality. Just love his style.</p>

        <p class="reflection">Obig</p>

        <p>Obig is an illustrator/designer that I came across on Sanghyuk Park's instagram. I was very pleasantly surpirsed when I went to his account and seen his work because it was very similar to the work of Sanghyuk Park but the way he uses line is so different. His composition and use of color is great. </p>
