            <p>I also read an article about Draco, which is a constraint-based system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). The idea of Draco is great and it certainly would make information visualization much faster and easier with aid of automated visualization design. But even after reading “modeling visualization design knowledge as a collection of constraints, in conjunction with a method to learn weights for soft constraints from experimental data”, I don’t believe that it would be able to make a visualization that is as successful as the one designed by a graphic designer. It’s just like Canva. Canva is a great website that makes it easier for non-designers to design magazine, cards, flyers, business card, etc. From a designer’s perspective, Canva eventually causes design problems that cannot be solved by a non-designer who uses the program to create something. Of course, Canva and Draco are different, I think they both are based on the same idea of attempting to make design easier for non-graphic designers. Designing something is such a delicate process that one pixel, one point affects how the whole outcome looks like, and I just do not believe that Draco would be able to create as creative and effective visualization as visualization by graphic designers.</p>
