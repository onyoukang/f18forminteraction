            <p>I came across a Korean website that talks about UI/UX. For me, discovering the website itself was interesting because I decided to study abroad in the U.S because I knew that persuing design career is not ideal in Korea because the industry is so small and there are not a lot of interest compared to the States. So when I seen the website that was dedicated to discussing UI/UX design and also other designs, I thought maybe now there is bigger market and more people have interest in design industry. <br>
            So I started reading couple of articles and I found the content of articles very interesting as well. Even though it is a Korean website written in Korean and targeting Korean audiences, it mostly discusses U.S. based companies and projects. Following are the few examples. </p>

            <p class="indent">I thought this one in particular was a perfect representation of how information design is used in Korea. It is used mostly on media to deliver information, but most of them are not visually considered.</p>

        <p>I love Nicholas Blechman's work in general that not only he is a great illustrator but also is an amazing information deisigner. He also does lots of editorial pieces which is super dope. I am planning to look into his work more in depth.</p>
