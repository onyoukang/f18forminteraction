        <p class="reflection">Vintage Ad Research</p>

        <div>
            <p>I searched for vintage ads -- mostly focused on fashion ads. As I was looking at bunch of ads I wanted to recreate some of them and it was kind of struggle because I didn't know what typefaces to use. I used multiple websites to figure out the typeface that I seen on certain ads and couldn't find some. This had me think that maybe the typefaces that were used back then are not even used now. It was hard to recreated the same vintage/retro feeling using the typefaces that I currently have on my laptop. </p>

        <p class="reflection">Brian Rea</p>

        <p>Brian Rea's illustrations/drawings are really cool that they are simple line drawings but have such finished quality. That is one of the things that I struggle with, and I think he is a great illustrator for me to look at and learn from.</p>
