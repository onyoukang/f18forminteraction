        <p class="reflection">I spent good amount of time looking at local dashboards regarding physical and financial helath, which had me realize that most of those could be improved. If the dashboards were easier to read and interact, user experience would be enhanced. As a result more people would be able to take advantage of these information that were initially visualized to help locals understand the statistics.</p>
