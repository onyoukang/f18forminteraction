        <p class="reflection">Capstone - names</p>

        <div>
            <p>I have been thinking of what I want to do for my capstone and I always knew that I wanted to do something related to culture and identity alongside with inequality and difference. Those are such broad topics that I was not sure how I would be able to cover it in just one capstone. Then I also thought about I want to narrate my experience and thought name would be a perfect entry point for all the things I wanted to talk about. So I did some research about names and just looked up some articles that people talk about their experience of having different names. </p>
